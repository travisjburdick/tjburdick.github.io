         <h1> The Eagle Nebula </h1>
      <p> When planning to visit a Nebula, it's important to remember a few key things about what actually makes them up before you head out. Nebula are comprised of gases and dusts, and while they look breath-taking from afar, especially when back-lit by stars, they would look much different in person. </p>
      <p> In fact, they would hardly be recognizable if you were to attempt to enter them. Just a dark, cloudy area of space. And even if you took a sight-seeing tour some distance away, they would look vastly different than how we see them from earth through telescopes. It's important to remember that the images we receive here on earth are altered images of the visible spectrum of light. Through a Telescope, these areas are viewed in X-Rays, Gamma Rays, amongst others-- which the human eye cannot perceive. </p>
      <p> It's also important when planning a trip to remember what most Nebula actually exist for. They're either back-lit by forming or newly born stars feeding on matter... or the remnants of collapsed stars and back-lit by intense levels of radiation agitating the gas. Either way, to actually hope to enter one would be most unsafe. </p>
