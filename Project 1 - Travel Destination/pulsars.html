      <h1> Pulsars </h1>
      <p> As with most of the things on our galactic hot spot list Pulsars are another natural wonder that looks beautiful to look at but are in fact completely and utterly lethal to humans. So once again, any vacation plans to such a destination would be from afar. </p>
      <p> The reason for this is that Pulsars are formed by collapsing stars that become so dense, they form Neutron Stars. On top of absolutely crushing gravity that no Tourist could hope to survive, the get to spinning so quickly, they emit actual beams of electromagnetic radiation. </p>
      <p> They are a remarkable natural occurrence both for the visual effect of EM Radiation, and can be seen as a pulsating flash through a telescope here on earth. But not only can they be seen, but they can be heard! Each Pulsar has it's own rhythm as it rotates and puts out radiation! A wonderful occurrence, but also quite deadly to humans. Only tours from afar are possible! </p>
